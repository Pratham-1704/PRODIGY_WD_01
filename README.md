This project demonstrates the creation of a responsive and visually engaging website with a focus on a dynamic navigation menu that remains fixed at the top of the page. The navigation menu is designed to enhance user interaction by changing its style when the user scrolls through the page or hovers over menu items. As users scroll down, the menu's background color shifts, making it more prominent and maintaining its visibility against the page content. This effect is achieved using JavaScript, which detects the scroll position and adjusts the menu's background color and shadow accordingly.

The hover effects are crafted using CSS, adding a smooth and modern touch to the user experience. Each menu item features a subtle underline that expands upon hover, coupled with a color change, making the navigation feel interactive and engaging. The menu itself is styled with a gradient background and a soft shadow, giving it a polished, contemporary look that stands out across different devices.
